Well the Maximilian's course is not the most up to date, despite claiming "2023 update". Few significant changes:

- there's no more RaisedButton available, so if you want to do with current version, you have to rewrite relevant pieces
- the start up code generated by Flutter, the class' boiler plates are different; actually better
- the newer versions of Flutter require you to adhere to null safety, and write strongly typed code. The linter is very picky, much more than what's in the course videos

Nevertheless, I've decided not to downgrade the Flutter version to make it compatible with the course content, but amend the code on the go.

### Couldn't run on iPhone

It works nice with Xcode and the simulators, but it seems that it's now blocked to run your app directly on wired iPhone from VSC directly. Following some clues, I run it on iPhone by opening project file from ios folder and running it from Xcode. I think hot-reload did not work in this scenario. It works okay when running on iPhone simulator (which VSC can start for you on itself)

### It's all widgets

There are many widgets. The problem is not with buttons now, but rather all those Column, Container - organization widgets and their parameters.

One thing that's also different in the new version of Flutter, is that concept of styling has changed. The way I see it, is that you don't provide colors directly to, say, a button, but you provide a class instance that represents the style. And the style elements can be inherited. Something CSS-like?

But setting colors of app button, letters and background proved to be difficult. What's with those primary and secondary? And those complex classes (or instances) containing constants or style? CopyFrom....

And how is one supposed to know that here or there you have to use an instance of EdgeInsets? Where's this name coming from?

### `const`

I watched some additional stuff about `const`, but still some elements are confusing. What does `const` mean in from of constructor definition? That the constructor reeturns const? Or that the constructor is a const itself? 
Apparently, the way they put the code two years ago is different to current version.

### Accessibility

The simple Flutter app works nicely with Apple's voice over out of box, which is very welcome.

It's all widgets again... I kind of like the way you built UI here. You don't directly position widgets on the screen by, say, providing coordinates, but you build the hierarchy and put widgets in organizing widgets that way controlling the layout on the screen. 
That would be so hard without the hot-reload.

I see this similiar to how you bild things with tools like EditorX. You do sections and then containers, grids, repeaters. Put widgets inside, define attachments, padding and behoviour. But EditorX is kind of wobbly.

Still missing the `const` concept. Why is this not a const?
```
Container(
    width: 100,
    child: const Text('CHART'),
)
```

Styling is still confusing. It's good that types of parameters are actually the names of the classes, for exmple:
`crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start`
but then you get `decoration` parameter of type `Decoration` that can take values of `BoxDecoration` type.

Some styling you do on a widget but others (depending on widget) you do on its parent. 

I guess you need to used to it. The question how "sustainable" is that. I mean, once you have a break in flutter coding, will you need to lear it all anew when you get back to developing?

## 2022-12-25

This is something really annoying. You go with a widget, and the linter complains to make it a `const`. Ok. But, some time later, you add something to the widget that makes it a constant no more. Now you have to remove `const` from the front of the widged, and add it to all apparently constant actuall arguments. 
And then you decide, to actually go back to original version and the fun happens one more time.

Sometimes I wish it was faster. Discussing over and over details of how widges are formatted makes me feel stuck. It would be better to get more concepts tought now.

Seems like a many of the challenges (eg lifting the state) can be solved in different manners. Well, I assume we're learning the "flutteral" way in Shwartzmuller's course.

I think I start to see how the state management is not at all replacement to MVC. It's just a framework thing, a convention on how to update GUI.

### Private methods passed to other library

This is kind of unclear. A `_privateMethod` is not available outside a library, right? But when passing it via "pointer" it can be used from within other library. 
I guess that underscore conventions makes it easy for compiler to check whether there's a call to private function, but it doesn't care to do any checks when things are passed around "behind the scenes".

### Scrollable column

It's interesting, that actually a column doesn't do scrolling, but you rather wrap it in dedicated scrollable widget. Makes sense.
